      <div class="About-Me">
        I am a student attending Renton Technical College, and am currently pursuing a degree in computer science(AAS). 
        Despite my current course of study, my ultimate career goal is to become a graphic designer or a video game developer. 
        I am highly motivated and determined to achieve my dream, and have been working hard to develop my skills in design and visual communication.
        I am going to take dditional classes outside of my degree program just to practice my craft through freelance work and personal projects. 
        I am excited about the possibilities that this education and experience will offer me in pursuing a career in graphic design,
        and am committed to continuing my learning and growth in this field.
